# Hi there 👋, I'm Stefan Gabriel Ene

I am an MS CS Systems student at Stanford University🌲, improving every day on my OS and secure systems development.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a privacy-preserving system for secure cloud LLM queries and on a custom lightweight OS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning privacy-preserving systems and blockchain technologies.

## Projects:

### [SecureLLM](https://github.com/Stefanene/secure-llm)

This project addresses secure communication with cloud LLMs using secured virtual machine (VM) environments. Making use of privacy concepts like public-key encryption, oblivious RAM, and private information retrieval, the aim of this project is to to improve the privacy of queries made to cloud LLM providers. The idea is for various users to send encrypted queries to a trusted execution environment, which performs its secure pre-processing steps. This Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) then sends anonymized queries to external LLM, then re-encrypts responses to send back to the user.</p>

### [Small Shell](https://github.com/Stefanene/Small-Shell/blob/main/smallsh.c)

This project was my first experience with low-level code within one of my first Operating Systems courses. This C program uses process forking to execute a few UNIX terminal commands, including `ls`, `cat`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `exit`, pipeline operators, and other process signals
